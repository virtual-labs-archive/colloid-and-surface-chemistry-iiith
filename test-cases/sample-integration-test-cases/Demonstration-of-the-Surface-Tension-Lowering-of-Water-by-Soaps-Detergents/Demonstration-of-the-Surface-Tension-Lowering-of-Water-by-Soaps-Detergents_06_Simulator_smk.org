* Objective
  - To view the Simulation of "Demonstration of the Surface Tension Lowering of Water by Soaps/Detergents" experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/colloid-and-surface-chemistry-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/sample-integration-test-cases/Demonstration-of-the-Surface-Tension-Lowering-of-Water-by-Soaps-Detergents/Demonstration-of-the-Surface-Tension-Lowering-of-Water-by-Soaps-Detergents_01_Usability_smk.org][Demonstration-of-the-Surface-Tension-Lowering-of-Water-by-Soaps-Detergents_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the "Simulation" link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Simulation page

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be  displayed on the screen
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters

* Review/comments
