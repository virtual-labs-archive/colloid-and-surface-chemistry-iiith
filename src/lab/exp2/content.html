Cooling of sols at Moderate Concentration: Agar-agar, gelatin gels are made by cooling
their sols having moderate concentrations prepared in hot water. As we know that hydrophilic
sols are extensively hydrated, when cooled, the hydrated particles agglomerate together to form
larger aggregates and finally led to form a semi-solid network structure of gel.

	<h><em> Preparation of a Gel as a Colloid: </em></h>
<p>
Lyophilic colloids that is normally stable but may be induced to coagulate partially under certain conditions (e.g. lowering the temperature). This produces a pseudo-solid or easily deformable jelly-like mass enclosing the entire amount of the liquid within itself. Such a product is called a gel, in which entertaining particles endorse the whole dispersing medium. Gel is a liquid-solid system in which a liquid is dispersed in a solid.
	Colloidal suspensions can be regarded as an ideal model system for emulsions, protein solutions, foods, and inks. When colloidal particles strongly attract with each other, they aggregate, phase-separate, and sometimes form gel. The basic understanding of this spatially heterogeneous jamming process is of crucial importance from both the scientific and industrial viewpoints. Here we study this problem using a &#8220;fluid-particle dynamics&#8221; simulation, which properly incorporates interparticle hydrodynamic interactions. Upon phase separation, a percolated network of colloidal particles is formed with a help of hydrodynamic interactions. Then the network structure coarsens with time by repeating the following elementary process: stress concentration at a weak part of the network, its breakup and the resulting mechanical relaxation to a new metastable state, and the stress concentration again. Contrary to the common belief, the coarsening proceeds even without any thermal noise: the thermal activation is not prerequisite for this type of coarsening. We show that the coarsening is primarily driven by self-generated mechanical stress. This remarkable kinetic pathway of purely mechanical origin may be universal to any mixtures with strong dynamic asymmetry between their components, such as polymer solutions, colloidal suspensions, emulsions, and protein solutions. This may have a significant implication on our basic understanding of network formation in soft- and bio-matter.

<strong>To start the experiment do the following: </strong>
<ol>
<li>
Put some small amount of Agarose in the flask [ Click on the agarose container&#8217;s spoon to pour]<br>
Agarose is a dried powder similar to gelatin but made from sea-weed.
</li>

<li>
Add some liquid buffer to the flask. The buffer is a salt-solution that will let electrical charges flow through the gel. [click on the liquid buffer conatiner for the above step].
</li>

<li>
We have loosely covered the top of the flask with plastic wrap to prevent it from boiling over. Open the microwave by pressing the open button. Place the flask in the microwave.
</li>

<li>
Heat the mixture till agarose melts into buffer.
</li>

<li>
We have removed the mixture plastic wrap. Pour the mixture in the mold by clicking on the flask.
</li>

<li>
After few moments it soldifies and gel-colloid is ready.
</li>
